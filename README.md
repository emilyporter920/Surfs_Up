## Summary
* **The temperatures for both June and December are fairly similar, partially due to O'ahu's location near the equator.**
* **Additional queries that would help aid in the decision include:**
     - Precipitation x Temperature for the month of June
     - Precipitation x Temperature for the month of December

### Noticeable Differences
* **Three notable differences:**
     - **June has a higher mean temperature of 75° F in comparison to December's mean temperature of 71° F.**
     - **December has a significantly higher frequency at ~ 71° F. This shows that December weather is commonly around the mean temperature and doesn't have much variation.**
     - **The overall difference in December and June precipitation x temperature is relatively low.**

* **The data collected suggests that there is no evident reason to believe that the Surf Shop will perform poorly due to the weather since there is no drastic difference in temperature and precipitation patterns between the summer months and winter months.**
